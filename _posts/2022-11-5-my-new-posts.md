## How did we get here?

I wanted to do something different as a programmer. I've always just been programming different scripts, whether it's some kind of automation, or just a toy that no one would probably use. 

I've decided that I would finally enter the world of websites and try making my own personal website. Thanks to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), this website was made pretty easily and I recommend anyone who wants to host a website to check them out!

## The Plan

My goal for this website is to try and post as much as I can, showing my progress as a developer. This would also be a place to show my differnt projects and what I've worked on.

There really isn't much else to say here, I just wanted to make sure I post something on Day 1, and see how things go from here!

Have a great one
